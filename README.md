Scene scattering tool for Godot Engine
=========================================

This plugin adds tools to help placing many scene instances in an environment by "painting" over it, rather than dragging and dropping them manually from the file system dock.

It is still a very rough prototype, use at your own risk.


Installation
--------------

This is a regular editor plugin.
Copy the contents of `addons/zylann.scatter` into the same folder in your project, and activate it in your project settings.
