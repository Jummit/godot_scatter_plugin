Scene scattering tool for Godot Engine
=========================================

![scatter_plugin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311555/61177048-a3fd4100-a5c3-11e9-8771-8667465ce439.gif)

This plugin adds tools to help placing many scene instances in an environment by "painting" over it, rather than dragging and dropping them manually from the file system dock.

It is still a very rough prototype, use at your own risk.


Installation
